	<h3>Legend of Zelda SEQUEL!!!!</h3>
	<h4>This game will win the best zelda game because the oringinal won a reward.By the way this is very imformational.The Sequel to Breath of The Wild happens after you defeat Ganon. Some weird evil guy comes up from a temple thingy. I assume that the weird evil guy is the guy you have to beat. He looks very tough so I want to avoid him. </h4>
	<h6>The real reason is because I dont have enough money to buy the game...</h6>
